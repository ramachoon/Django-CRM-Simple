# Django-CRM-Simple
I've developed a CRM project in Django, a Python web framework. It streamlines customer interactions, with features like contact management, lead tracking, and task scheduling, helping businesses enhance customer relationships.

### How to run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
You can check out the project by opening `localhost:8000/home` in a web browser.
